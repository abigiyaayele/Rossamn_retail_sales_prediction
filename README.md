# Rossmann Pharmaceuticals Sales Forecasting

## Overview

This project aims to build an end-to-end system for predicting daily sales in Rossmann Pharmaceuticals stores across several cities, six weeks ahead of time. The goal is to provide the finance team with accurate forecasts to help in better planning and decision-making. The solution involves both traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches, ensuring robust and scalable predictions.

## Problem Statement

Rossmann Pharmaceuticals operates multiple stores across different cities. The finance team needs accurate sales forecasts to make informed decisions and allocate resources effectively. Currently, store managers rely on their intuition and experience, but a more data-driven approach is desired.

## Business Need

The finance team at Rossmann Pharmaceuticals currently relies on store managers' experience and judgment to forecast sales. The need for a more systematic and data-driven approach is evident, as accurate sales predictions can significantly impact inventory management, staffing, and promotional strategies.

## approach
###  1: Exploration of Customer Purchasing Behavior
      - Data Cleaning
      - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

###  2: Prediction of Store Sales
      - Model Building with Sklearn Pipelines

###  3: Building Model with Deep Learning
     - LSTM Regression Model

## Deliverables

1. **Exploratory Analysis Notebook**:
   - A comprehensive notebook answering the exploratory questions with visualizations and insights.

2. **Machine Learning Model**:
   - Serialized sklearn model with feature importance analysis and confidence intervals.

3. **Deep Learning Model**:
   - LSTM regression model trained on time series data.

4. **Web Interface**:
   - An interface for serving the predictions to the finance team.
